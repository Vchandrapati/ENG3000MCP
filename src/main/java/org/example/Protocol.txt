Train assumptions
- Train has three states, OFF, ON and ERROR
- When ON -> train can move around the track
- When OFF -> train has not connected but not been started by the server
- when -> ERROR something wrong has happened to a train
- Train can pass through staton when OFF

Station assumptions
- Station has three states, OPENDOOR, CLOSEDDOOR, OFF
- When CLOSEDOOR -> Train can enter station, then the train will stop for a set time, station doors open, then close then the train goes OFF
- When OPENDOOR -> Train cannot enter as another train is in the station, thus the train must wait outside until the doors are closed
- When OFF -> Train can pass through as if there is no station

Client Server Communication Protocol

- Server will send "ACK trainInit" or "ACK stationInit" respective of the last message
- Client will receive the ack and then send the details for the respective entity
- IF TRAIN : Client will send "train,pos,speed" where pos is a double in the range between (0 - 0.5)
and where speed is a double in the range between (0.01 - 0.1)
- IF STATION : Client will send "station,pos" where pos is a double in the range between (0 - 180)
- Server will send "confirmed Train" or "confirmed Station"
